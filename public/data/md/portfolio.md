### Charles Schwab Developer Portal
2020 May – current

- Application: Angular 9, SCSS
- Testing: Jasmine, Protractor, Cucumber, Chai

Implemented the third version of the Schwab Developer Portal, currently in beta. This version
addressed the accessibility, responsive, and UX concerns found in the previous version. In addition,
the implementation allowed for more flexibility than the previous CMS implementation. The application is
currently in the release 1 phase. You can see some of my contributions at the links below.

### Restaurant365 Platform (Version 2)
2020 January – 2020 March

- Application: React, Redux, Redux Sagas
- Testing: Jest, Testing Library, StorybookJS

Implemented the React powered front end for the new version of the R365 platform. As part of the
Operations team my contributions included the In Store Experience dashboard and an updated

product Restaurant 365 sells to restaurant owners; as a result I have no links to share.

### Restaurant365 Platform (Version 1)
2020 January – 2020 March

- Application: Angular.js, KendoUI

Organized and modularized code in a largely undocumented codebase to allow Restaurant 365
to sell the platform as standalone solutions rather than only being suite of accounting,
operations, and scheduling tools. Implemented Stand-Alone Ops functionality for the front
end application. The software is a product Restaurant 365 sells to restaurant owners; as
a result I have no links to share.

### GroupBy Enrich
2019 January – 2019 December

- Application (Server): Node.js, TypeScript, Express, Postgresql
- Application (UI): Angular, Micro Frontends, React
- Testing (Server): Jest, Sinon
- Testing (UI): Mocha, Chai, Sinon

Architected and implemented the second version of GroupBy's Enrich application, with a focus on
performance, improved UX, and maintainability. Backend stayed in Typescript for the entirety
while the front end went through several iterations from Angular, to a Micro Frontends
approach using SystemJS with React and Custom Elements support.

### GroupBy Enrich Legacy
2018 October – 2019 December

- Application (Server): Node.js, JavaScript, Express, Postgresql, Ruby, Elasticsearch
- Application (UI): Angular.js 1.3
- Testing (Server): Mocha, Chai

Maintained and added features to the legacy data enrichment platform owned by GroupBy. In
addition to maintenance and features I contributed to increasing test coverage, migrating
the front end build from Grunt to Webpack, isolating the front end from the backend, and
incorporating Docker by migrating the production builds to Docker and utilizing Docker
Compose to streamline the development process. An internal tool so I have no public pages
to demo.
